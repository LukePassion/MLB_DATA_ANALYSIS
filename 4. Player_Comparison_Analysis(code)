4.PLAYER COMPARISON ANALYSIS


-- 2. Which players have the same birthday?
WITH born AS (SELECT CAST(CONCAT (birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE) AS birthdate, nameGiven
              FROM players)
SELECT birthdate, GROUP_CONCAT(nameGiven SEPARATOR', ') AS players
FROM born
WHERE YEAR(birthdate) BETWEEN 1980 AND 1990
GROUP BY birthdate
ORDER BY birthdate;   


-- 3. Create a summary table that shows for each team, what percent of players bat right, left and both
SELECT s.teamID,
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN p.bats = 'R'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(s.playerID) * 100, 1) AS right_percent,
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN p.bats = 'L'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(s.playerID) * 100, 1) AS left_percent,
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN p.bats = 'B'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(s.playerID) * 100, 1) AS both_percent

FROM salaries s LEFT JOIN players p
ON   s.playerID = p.playerID
GROUP BY s.teamID;


-- 4. How have average height and weight at debut game changed over the years, and what's the decade-over-decade difference?
WITH hw AS (SELECT ROUND(YEAR(debut), -1) AS decade, AVG(height) AS avg_height, AVG(weight) AS avg_weight
                       FROM players
					   GROUP BY decade)
SELECT decade,
       avg_height - LAG(avg_height) OVER(ORDER BY decade) AS height_diff,
       avg_weight - LAG(avg_weight) OVER(ORDER BY decade) AS weight_diff
FROM hw
WHERE decade IS NOT NULL;
