-- PART III: PLAYER CAREER ANALYSIS
-- 1. View the players table and find the number of players in the table
SELECT COUNT(playerID) AS number_of_players
FROM players;


SELECT * FROM players;
2. For each player, calculate their age at their first game, their last game, and their career length (all in years). Sort from longest career to shortest career.
SELECT nameGiven,
	   TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), debut) 
					 AS starting_age,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), finalGame) 
                     AS ending_age,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, debut, finalGame) AS career_lenght
FROM   players
ORDER BY career_lenght DESC;       


-- 3. What team did each player play on for their starting and ending years?
SELECT p.nameGiven,
       s.yearID AS starting_year, s.teamID AS starting_team,
       e.yearID AS ending_year, e.teamID AS ending_team
FROM players p INNER JOIN salaries s
                          ON p.playerID = s.playerID
						  AND YEAR(p.debut) = s.yearID
               INNER JOIN salaries e
						  ON p.playerID = e.playerID
                          AND YEAR(p.finalGame) = e.yearID;


-- 4. How many players started and ended on the same team and also played for over a decade?
SELECT p.nameGiven,
       s.yearID AS starting_year, s.teamID AS starting_team,
       e.yearID AS ending_year, e.teamID AS ending_team
FROM players p INNER JOIN salaries s
                          ON p.playerID = s.playerID
						  AND YEAR(p.debut) = s.yearID
               INNER JOIN salaries e
						  ON p.playerID = e.playerID
                          AND YEAR(p.finalGame) = e.yearID
WHERE s.teamID = e.teamID AND e.yearID - s.yearID > 10;
